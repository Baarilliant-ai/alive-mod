# Mod Info Function

## What Is the Mod Info Function?

The Mod Info function allows villagers to tell you about the Alive mod itself. This is a fun way to learn about who created the mod while staying immersed in the game world.

## How It Works

When you ask a villager about the mod or who made it, they'll respond with information about the creators (baarilliant.ai) and add a personal touch based on their current location.

## Why Ask About the Mod?

- **Learn About the Creators**: Discover who made the Alive mod
- **Immersive Experience**: Get mod information without breaking immersion
- **Location-Specific Responses**: Each biome triggers different responses
- **Easter Egg**: It's a fun little feature to discover

## How to Trigger Mod Info

You can get information about the mod by:

1. **Direct Questions**: Ask "Who made this mod?" or "Tell me about Alive"
2. **Specific Inquiries**: Ask "Who created you?" or "Where did you come from?"
3. **Chat Suggestions**: Click on a suggestion related to the mod if one appears

## Example Mod Info Responses

The response will always include information about the creator (baarilliant.ai) but will be customized based on the biome where the conversation takes place:

**In Plains Biome:**
"Alive is made by baarilliant.ai. We love the plains with their gentle rolling hills and open spaces."

**In Desert Biome:**
"Alive is made by baarilliant.ai. We love the desert with its golden sands and clear skies."

**In Forest Biome:**
"Alive is made by baarilliant.ai. We love the forest with its towering trees and abundant wildlife."
