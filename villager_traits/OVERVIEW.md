# Villager Traits System Overview

## What Are Villager Traits?

In the Alive mod, villager traits are the characteristics, personalities, and behaviors that make each villager unique and lifelike. These traits are determined by the villager's profession and create a rich, immersive experience when interacting with villagers.

## How the Trait System Works

Every villager in Minecraft has a profession (Farmer, Librarian, etc.). In the Alive mod, each profession has its own set of possible traits that reflect that profession's role in the village. For example, Farmers have traits related to agriculture and weather, while Librarians have traits related to knowledge and books.

When you interact with a villager, their traits influence:

- How they speak to you
- What knowledge they share
- Their reactions to different situations
- Their personal stories and history
- Their goals and fears

## Trait Categories

Villagers have many different trait categories that define who they are:

### Core Traits

1. **Archetypes**: Their role or specialty within their profession (e.g., a Farmer might be a "Harvester" or "Crop Master")
2. **Personalities**: Their general temperament and behavior (friendly, cautious, wise, etc.)
3. **Backstories**: Their personal history and significant life events
4. **Goals**: What they're working toward or hope to achieve
5. **Fears**: What worries or scares them
6. **Quirks**: Unique habits, behaviors, or mannerisms

### Additional Traits

7. **Speech Patterns**: How they talk and express themselves
8. **Physical Traits**: Distinctive appearance characteristics
9. **Relationships**: How they interact with others in the village
10. **Values**: What principles or ideals are important to them
11. **Hobbies**: Activities they enjoy outside their profession
12. **Cultural Background**: Regional influences and traditions
13. **Age Group**: Young, middle-aged, or elder, with age-appropriate traits
14. **Life Events**: Significant experiences that shaped them
15. **Emotional State**: Their current mood or emotional tendencies

## How Traits Affect Gameplay

Villager traits enhance your Minecraft experience in several ways:

- **More Engaging Conversations**: Each villager has unique dialogue based on their traits
- **Specialized Knowledge**: Villagers share information related to their profession and traits

- How the villager speaks
- What topics they bring up
- Their reactions to different questions
- References to their past or future plans
