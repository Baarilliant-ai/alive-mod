## Conversation Tips

When talking to Nitwit villagers, try these topics:

- Ask about their dreams or thoughts
- Share simple experiences like watching clouds or stars

Nitwits offer a completely different perspective on the Minecraft world. While they don't provide practical trades or profession-specific knowledge, their unique viewpoint can be refreshing and sometimes surprisingly insightful. They remind players that there's more to village life than just work and trading.
