# Correct Answer

## What Is the Correct Answer Function?

The Correct Answer function allows villagers to ask you questions and respond differently based on whether your answer is correct. This creates an interactive quiz-like experience where you can test your knowledge and potentially earn rewards.

## How It Works

During a conversation with a villager, they might ask you a question related to their profession or knowledge. When you respond:

1. The villager evaluates if your answer is correct
2. If correct, they might reward you with items, knowledge, or other benefits
3. They'll provide a response based on whether your answer was right or wrong

## Example Interactions

**Librarian Villager:**

- Question: "Do you know which ancient civilization built the first libraries?"
- Your Answer: "The Sumerians"
- Response (if correct): "Indeed! The Sumerians created the first known libraries around 3000 BCE. Here's a special book I've been saving for someone knowledgeable."

**Farmer Villager:**

- Question: "When is the best time to plant wheat seeds?"
- Your Answer: "Spring"
- Response (if correct): "That's right! Spring gives the wheat enough time to grow before harvest. I have some extra seeds you might find useful."
