# Chat Links

## What Are Chat Links?

Chat Links are suggested responses that appear when you're talking to villagers. These suggestions make conversations more natural and interactive by giving you options to choose from.

## How It Works

When you're chatting with a villager, they'll offer you 1-3 suggested responses based on the conversation history. These suggestions appear as clickable text that you can select to continue the conversation.

For example, if a farmer villager tells you about their crops, you might see suggestions like:

- "Tell me more about your wheat"
- "Do you have any farming tips?"
- "How has the weather been for growing?"

## Benefits of Chat Links

- **Easier Conversations**: No need to type out responses - just click and continue
- **Natural Flow**: Keeps conversations flowing naturally
- **Discover New Topics**: Suggestions might lead to topics you wouldn't have thought to ask about
- **Relationship Building**: Helps you have more meaningful interactions with villagers

1. **Start a conversation** with any villager
2. **Look for the suggested responses** that appear in your chat
3. **Click on any suggestion** that interests you
4. **Continue the conversation** with new suggestions that appear
