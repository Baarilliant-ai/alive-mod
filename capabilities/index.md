# Villager Capabilities

The Alive mod adds several special abilities that enhance your interactions with villagers. These capabilities make villagers more interactive and lifelike, giving you a more immersive Minecraft experience.

## Available Capabilities

### [Chat Links]({{ site.baseurl }}/capabilities/CHAT_LINKS)

When talking to villagers, they'll suggest possible responses for you to choose from. This makes conversations more natural and interactive. You'll see 1-3 suggested responses that you can click on to continue the conversation.

### [Correct Answer]({{ site.baseurl }}/capabilities/CORRECT_ANSWER)

Villagers can ask you questions during your conversations. If you answer correctly, they might reward you with items, knowledge, or other benefits. Each villager has different knowledge based on their profession.

### [Find Villager]({{ site.baseurl }}/capabilities/FIND)

Ask the AI villager to locate another specific villager by name within the vicinity. The found villager will glow briefly, making them easy to spot. Requires the target villager to have a custom name.

### [Goodbye]({{ site.baseurl }}/capabilities/GOODBYE)

When you're done talking to a villager, you can properly say goodbye. This helps build your relationship with the villager and they'll remember your interaction for next time. Building good relationships with villagers can lead to better trades and more helpful interactions.

### [Look Around]({{ site.baseurl }}/capabilities/LOOK_AROUND)

Villagers can tell you about their surroundings within about 32 blocks. They might spot:

- Nearby entities (other villagers, hostile mobs, players, animals)
- Points of interest (workstations, beds, bells)
- Valuable resources (ore blocks like coal, iron, gold, diamond)

This is great for exploring new areas or finding hidden treasures!

### [Mod Info]({{ site.baseurl }}/capabilities/MOD_INFO)

You can ask villagers about the mod itself. They'll tell you who made the mod (baarilliant.ai) and add a personal touch based on their location. This is a fun way to learn more about the mod and its creators.

### [Open Trade Menu]({{ site.baseurl }}/capabilities/OPEN_TRADE)

During your conversation with a villager, you can easily open their trading menu. This allows you to see and interact with the villager's available trades without having to end the conversation. This only works with villagers who have trades available.

### [Resume Activity]({{ site.baseurl }}/capabilities/RESUME)

Allows you to tell a waiting villager to stop waiting and return to their normal activities.

### [Wait]({{ site.baseurl }}/capabilities/WAIT)

Instruct a villager to stop following you and remain stationary at their current location.

### [Who Is About]({{ site.baseurl }}/capabilities/WHO_IS_ABOUT)

Ask the AI villager for a summary of other known villagers (from the mod's data store) who are currently present in the world, regardless of distance.

## How to Use Capabilities

These capabilities happen naturally during your conversations with villagers. As you talk to them, they'll use these abilities to make the interaction more interesting and helpful.
