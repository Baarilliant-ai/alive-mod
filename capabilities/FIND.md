# Find Villager Function

## What Is the Find Villager Function?

The Find Villager function allows the AI entity (the villager you are interacting with) to locate another specific villager by their name within a certain range (256 blocks). When found, the target villager will briefly glow, making them easy to spot.

## How It Works

When you ask the AI entity to find a specific villager by name (e.g., "Can you find Bob?"), it uses this function. The AI scans the nearby area for villagers. If it finds a villager with a matching name, it will apply a glowing effect to that villager for about 15 seconds and confirm that it has highlighted them.

## Benefits of Using Find Villager

- **Locating Specific Villagers:** Easily find a particular villager in a crowded area or when you don't know their exact location.
- **Task Assistance:** Useful if you need to interact with a specific villager but can't immediately see them.
- **Immersion:** Adds another layer of interaction and capability to the AI entities.

## How to Trigger Find Villager

You can ask the AI entity to find another villager by:

1.  **Direct Request:** Ask "Find [Villager Name]" or "Where is [Villager Name]?" or "Can you point out [Villager Name]?"
2.  **Chat Suggestions:** Click on a suggestion related to finding a villager if one appears.

_Note: The target villager must have a custom name (assigned via a name tag) for this function to work._

## Example Find Villager Interaction

**You:** "Hey, can you find Alice the Farmer for me?"
**AI Villager:** "Okay, I've highlighted Alice." (Alice the Farmer starts glowing nearby).

**You:** "Where is Bob?"
**AI Villager:** "Sorry, I couldn't find a villager named 'Bob' nearby." (If Bob isn't within range or doesn't have that custom name).

## Tips for Using Find Villager

- Ensure the villager you want to find has been given a custom name using a name tag.
- The target villager needs to be within roughly 64 blocks of the AI entity you are talking to.
- The name matching is case-insensitive ("Bob" will find "bob").

The Find Villager function is a convenient way to locate specific villagers with the help of your AI companion.
