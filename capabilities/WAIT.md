# Wait

This capability allows the player to instruct a villager they are interacting with to stop following them and remain stationary at their current location.

## Functionality

When the player gives a command like "Wait here", "Stay put", or "Stop following me", the AI can trigger the `make_wait` function.

## Example Interaction

**Player:** "Wait here for a moment."
**Villager:** "Okay, I will wait here."

_(Villager stops moving and stays in place)_
