# AI Functions in the Alive Mod

The Alive mod adds several special abilities that enhance your interactions with villagers. These functions make villagers more interactive and lifelike, giving you a more immersive Minecraft experience.

## Available Functions

### Chat Links

When talking to villagers, they'll suggest possible responses for you to choose from. This makes conversations more natural and interactive. You'll see 1-3 suggested responses that you can click on to continue the conversation.

### Correct Answer

Villagers can ask you questions during your conversations. If you answer correctly, they might reward you with items, knowledge, or other benefits. Each villager has different knowledge based on their profession.

### Goodbye

When you're done talking to a villager, you can properly say goodbye. This helps build your relationship with the villager and they'll remember your interaction for next time. Building good relationships with villagers can lead to better trades and more helpful interactions.

### Look Around

Villagers can tell you about their surroundings within about 32 blocks. They might spot:

- Nearby entities (other villagers, hostile mobs, players, animals)
- Points of interest (workstations, beds, bells)
- Valuable resources (ore blocks like coal, iron, gold, diamond)

This is great for exploring new areas or finding hidden treasures!

### Mod Info

You can ask villagers about the mod itself. They'll tell you who made the mod (baarilliant.ai) and add a personal touch based on their location. This is a fun way to learn more about the mod and its creators.

### Open Trade Menu

During your conversation with a villager, you can easily open their trading menu. This allows you to see and interact with the villager's available trades without having to end the conversation. This only works with villagers who have trades available.
