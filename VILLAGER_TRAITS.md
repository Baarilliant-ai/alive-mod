# Villager Traits in the Alive Mod

{: .important }

> Currently, Villager Traits only affect the conversation style and have no effect on the game.

## How Traits Work

Every villager in the Alive mod has a set of traits that define their personality, appearance, behavior, and more. These traits are determined by the villager's profession (Farmer, Librarian, etc.) and make each villager feel like a unique individual.

When you interact with a villager, you'll notice their distinct personality coming through in how they talk and behave. A farmer might talk about crops and weather, while a librarian might discuss books and knowledge.

## Trait Categories

Villagers have many different trait categories that define who they are:

### Core Traits

1. **Archetypes**: Their role in society (like "Harvester" for farmers)
2. **Personalities**: How they behave (friendly, grumpy, wise, etc.)
3. **Backstories**: Their personal history and experiences
4. **Goals**: What they're working toward
5. **Fears**: What worries them
6. **Quirks**: Unique habits or behaviors

### Additional Traits

7. **Speech Patterns**: How they talk
8. **Physical Traits**: How they look
9. **Relationships**: How they interact with others
10. **Values**: What's important to them
11. **Hobbies**: What they do for fun
12. **Cultural Background**: Where they come from
13. **Age Group**: Young, middle-aged, or elder
14. **Life Events**: Important things that happened to them
15. **Emotional State**: How they're feeling right now

## How to Discover Traits

As you interact with villagers, you'll naturally discover their traits through conversation. Here are some tips:

1. **Talk to them multiple times**: Each conversation reveals more about their personality
2. **Ask about their profession**: They'll share knowledge related to their work
3. **Listen for speech patterns**: How they talk gives clues about their personality
4. **Notice their reactions**: Different villagers react differently to the same situations
5. **Build relationships**: The more you talk to a villager, the more they'll open up

## Why Traits Matter
