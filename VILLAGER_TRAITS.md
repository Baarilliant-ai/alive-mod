# Villager Traits in the Alive Mod

The Alive mod brings your Minecraft villagers to life with unique personalities and traits based on their profession. This guide explains how the villager traits system works and what makes each villager unique.

## How Traits Work

Every villager in the Alive mod has a set of traits that define their personality, appearance, behavior, and more. These traits are determined by the villager's profession (Farmer, Librarian, etc.) and make each villager feel like a unique individual.

When you interact with a villager, you'll notice their distinct personality coming through in how they talk and behave. A farmer might talk about crops and weather, while a librarian might discuss books and knowledge.

## Trait Categories

Villagers have many different trait categories that define who they are:

### Core Traits

1. **Archetypes**: Their role in society (like "Harvester" for farmers)
2. **Personalities**: How they behave (friendly, grumpy, wise, etc.)
3. **Backstories**: Their personal history and experiences
4. **Goals**: What they're working toward
5. **Fears**: What worries them
6. **Quirks**: Unique habits or behaviors

### Additional Traits

7. **Speech Patterns**: How they talk
8. **Physical Traits**: How they look
9. **Relationships**: How they interact with others
10. **Values**: What's important to them
11. **Hobbies**: What they do for fun
12. **Cultural Background**: Where they come from
13. **Age Group**: Young, middle-aged, or elder
14. **Life Events**: Important things that happened to them
15. **Emotional State**: How they're feeling right now

## How to Discover Traits

As you interact with villagers, you'll naturally discover their traits through conversation. Here are some tips:

1. **Talk to them multiple times**: Each conversation reveals more about their personality
2. **Ask about their profession**: They'll share knowledge related to their work
3. **Listen for speech patterns**: How they talk gives clues about their personality
4. **Notice their reactions**: Different villagers react differently to the same situations
5. **Build relationships**: The more you talk to a villager, the more they'll open up

## Why Traits Matter

Understanding a villager's traits can help you:

- Find specific information related to their expertise
- Build better relationships for improved trading
- Discover unique stories and perspectives
- Get help with tasks related to their profession
- Have more meaningful and enjoyable interactions
