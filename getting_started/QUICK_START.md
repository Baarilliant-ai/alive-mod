# Quick Start Guide for Alive Mod

This guide will help you get started with using the Alive mod after installation. Follow these simple steps to begin interacting with AI-powered villagers in your Minecraft world.

## Basic Interaction

### Starting a Conversation

1. Find a villager in your Minecraft world
2. Hold down the **Shift** key
3. **Left-click** on the villager
4. Say "hi" or another greeting in the chat to begin the conversation

The villager will respond based on their profession, personality, and the mode you're using (Adventure or Creative).

### During Conversations

- The villager will follow you while you're in conversation
- You can ask questions about crafting, game mechanics, or engage in roleplay
- The villager will respond based on their knowledge and personality
- You can move around freely while chatting

### Ending a Conversation

- Simply say "goodbye" or similar farewell phrases in the chat
- The villager will stop following you and return to their normal behavior

## Custom Villager Prompts

You can customize how specific villagers respond by creating custom prompts:

### Named Villager Prompts

1. **Name a Villager**: Use a Name Tag to give a villager a unique name
2. **Create a Book and Quill**: Craft or obtain a Book and Quill
3. **Write Your Prompt**: Write instructions for how the villager should behave, what they know, etc.
4. **Sign the Book**: Sign the book with the exact same name as the villager
5. **Apply the Prompt**: Sneak-click (hold Shift and right-click) the book in the air to set the prompt

Example prompt content:

```
You are Elric, the village blacksmith. You've been forging weapons for 30 years and are known for your grumpy personality but excellent craftsmanship. You have a secret passion for poetry that few know about. You're knowledgeable about all types of metals and their properties.
```

### World Prompts

To set a prompt for all unnamed villagers:

1. Create a Book and Quill
2. Title it exactly "World" when signing
3. Write your world-building prompt in the book
4. Sneak-click the book in the air to apply it

Example world prompt:

```
This village was founded 200 years ago after a great war. The villagers are generally distrustful of outsiders but warm up quickly to those who help them. The village is known for its unique blue-tinted iron ore found in nearby caves.
```

## Tips for Better Interactions

- **Be specific** in your questions and statements
- **Stay in character** for more immersive roleplay
- **Ask about their profession** to get specialized knowledge
- **Remember previous conversations** as villagers will have memory of past interactions
- **Experiment with different approaches** to see how villagers respond

## Example Conversation Topics

- Ask a Farmer about crop growing techniques
- Discuss weapon crafting with a Weaponsmith
- Inquire about local history from any villager
- Ask about nearby resources or locations
- Discuss village politics and relationships
- Request advice on building or crafting

## Limitations

- Alive mod is only aware of in-game features, lore, and capabilities
- It cannot answer questions about real-world events or facts
- The free version has guardrails to ensure appropriate content
