tbh if you have the mod in your mods folder you can sneak click a villager and start chattin.

This Getting Started guide is divided into several pages to help you get up and running with Alive mod:

## Basic Usage

To start using Alive mod after installation:

1. Find a villager in your Minecraft world
2. Hold down the **Shift** key
3. **Left-click** on the villager
4. Say "hi" or another greeting in the chat

The villager will respond based on their profession, personality, and the mode you're using (Adventure or Creative).

## Adventure vs. Creative Mode

Alive mod offers two distinct modes:

- **Adventure Mode** (Default): Villagers are automatically enabled as interactive AI characters
- **Creative Mode**: Requires books and quills for interactions, doesn't enable characters automatically

For more details on the differences between these modes, see the [Game Modes]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting_started/MODES) page.
