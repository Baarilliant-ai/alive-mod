# Installing Alive Mod

This guide will walk you through the process of installing the Alive mod for Minecraft, which brings villagers to life through AI conversations.

## Requirements

- **Minecraft**: Java Edition (1.19.4 or later recommended)
- **Mod Loader**: Fabric Mod Loader
- **Dependencies**: Fabric API

## Installation Methods

### Method 1: Using a Mod Platform (Recommended)

#### Modrinth

1. Visit the [Alive mod page on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/alive)
2. Click the "Install" button
3. Select your preferred launcher (such as Prism, MultiMC, or CurseForge)
4. Follow the launcher-specific instructions to complete the installation

#### CurseForge

1. Visit the [Alive mod page on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alive)
2. Click the "Download" button
3. If you have the CurseForge launcher installed, it should automatically open
4. Alternatively, manually download the file and place it in your mods folder

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Download the Alive mod JAR file from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/alive) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alive)
2. Locate your Minecraft installation folder:
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\.minecraft`
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft`
   - Linux: `~/.minecraft`
3. Inside your Minecraft folder, navigate to (or create) the `mods` folder
4. Place the downloaded JAR file into the `mods` folder
5. Ensure you also have the Fabric API mod installed in the same folder

## Verification

1. Launch Minecraft with the Fabric profile
2. Click on "Mods" from the main menu
3. Verify that "Alive" appears in the list of installed mods
4. Start a new world or load an existing one
5. Approach a villager, hold Shift, and left-click to initiate a conversation

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the installation:

- Ensure you have the correct version of Minecraft and Fabric installed
- Check that you have installed the required Fabric API
- Verify that the mod JAR file is placed directly in the `mods` folder, not in a subfolder
- Make sure there are no conflicting mods installed
