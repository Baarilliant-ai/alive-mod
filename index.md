## What is Alive Mod?

Alive brings villagers to life through AI conversations and enhances both the utility and narrative depth of the game. Whether you need practical advice on crafting and gameplay mechanics or wish to weave intricate lore and RPG-style interactions, Alive Mod brings your world to life.

## Adventure vs. Creative Mode

Alive mod offers two distinct modes of operation:

### Adventure Mode (Default)

Adventure Mode is designed for immersive gameplay with minimal setup:

- Villagers are automatically enabled as interactive AI characters
- Simply Shift + left-click on any villager to start a conversation
- Perfect for players who want a seamless, immersive experience

### Creative Mode

Creative Mode offers more control and customization:

- Villagers are not automatically enabled as AI characters
- Requires Books and Quills to create custom prompts for villagers
- Ideal for map makers, server administrators, and players who want precise control
